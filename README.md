#### List of saved playlist

It is not possible to list saved playlists. See https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/79957181


#### Watch Later playlist:


https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/revision_history#september-15-2016 :
 
The channel resource's contentDetails.relatedPlaylists.watchHistory and contentDetails.relatedPlaylists.watchLater 
properties now contain values of HL and WL, respectively, for all channels.

To be clear, these properties are only visible to an authorized user retrieving data about the user's own channel. 
The properties always contain the values HL and WL, even for an authorized user retrieving data about the user's own channel. 
Thus, the watch history and watch later playlist IDs cannot be retrieved via the API.

In addition, requests to retrieve playlist details (playlists.list) or playlist items (playlistItems.list) for a 
channel's watch history or watch later playlist now return empty lists. This behavior is true for the new values, HL and WL,
 as well as for any watch history or watch later playlist IDs that your API Client may have already stored.
